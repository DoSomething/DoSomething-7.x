     <h3>Diane Nash, 22</h3>
     <p>After seeing public bathrooms marked “white” or “colored” as a student in Nashville Tennessee, Nash was determined to fight racism. She attended nonviolent, civil disobedience workshops lead by Rev. James Lawson, and became a leader of the Nashville sit-ins, a nonviolent tactic to integrate restaurants around the city. Students would sit in “whites only” sections of lunch counters, accepting arrest and even violence to prove a point about making a change. She also helped found and led the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, the largest student activist group that led key grassroots action against discrimination during the civil rights movement.</p>

     <h3>Barbara Johns, 16</h3>
     <p>As a student, she was part of a segregated school district in Virginia that crammed 450 kids into a 200 person building. She started a two week strike with the help of the NAACP to advocate for an integrated school district, marching to the town courthouse to make officials aware of the large difference in quality between black and white schools. In response, her house was burned to the ground. NAACP took her case to court, which became a part of the groundbreaking Brown v. Board of Education case that ruled "separate but equal” facilities based on race illegal.</p>

     <h3>James Zwerg, 22</h3>
     <p>He developed an interest in civil rights after seeing his African-American roommate experience prejudice. Attending an exchange program, he went to Fisk University and met John Lewis, a leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and decided to go on a Freedom Ride, a nonviolent action to test out integration laws on buses. He was arrested, and at one point ambushed during the ride. He was beaten so badly he was unconscious for two days and stayed in a hospital for five. His photos were used in many newspapers and magazines across the country, stirring even more support for the civil rights movement.</p>
