	<p>It started with seven words. “Let’s do something and we’ll all win.”</p>
	<p>Inspired by this speech given by former President Bill Clinton, Andrew Shue and Michael Sanchez, created Do Something, Inc., to get teens involved in giving back to their communities.</p>
	<p>20 years later and DoSomething.org has grown to inspire over 1.4 million teens to give back to their community--in 2012 alone--via cause campaigns, social grants, bootcamps, and more.</p>
	<p>Join us as we celebrate the past 20 years via a celebrity-filled journey that highlights our 20 pivotal moments.</p>
