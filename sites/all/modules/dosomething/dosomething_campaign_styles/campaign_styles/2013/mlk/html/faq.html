  <h4>What’s this game about?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Great leaders, like Martin Luther King Jr., fought for equal rights, but it took many people risking their lives to change legal discrimination in this country. This game puts you in the shoes of these unknown people who risked their lives to change their communities for the better. It’s 10 steps and takes less than 10 mins to complete.</p>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Why should I participate? </h4>
  <div>
    <p>You’ll step back into the past (who said there’s no such thing as time machines?) to see how activism changed our country, and how those same tactics can change society today. <a class="jump_scroll" href="#scholarship">Challenge six friends</a> and you’ll also qualify for a scholarship. </p>

  <h4>What is segregation? </h4>
  <div>
    <p>To get technical it’s the “separation of human beings into racial groups in daily life.” To put it simply, laws were used during the 20th century to keep groups separate and to discriminate against minority groups. These laws are no longer in place, but discrimination still exists. </p>
  </div>

  <h4>When did legal segregation end?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed major forms of discrimination against racial, ethnic, gender, and religious groups, but it took many years of grassroots activism for these changes to actually happen. There are still many inequalities in housing, job opportunities, education, and health access for many minority groups that were born from the laws of the past.</p>

  <h4>Who is Dr. Martin Luther King and why does he have a holiday?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Martin Luther King Jr. is a famous leader of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He is best known for using non-violent civil disobedience (refusal to follow certain laws) to fight legal discrimination. He was ultimately assassinated at the age of 39 because of his beliefs and active fight for equality for all individuals. A holiday was created to honor of his great accomplishments.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why are there only two races represented in the game?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>We know, labels are problematic (and complicated). There are many ways we can identify one another, but the game focuses on a black  male and white female to show the extremes in experiences common during the 1960s.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Are the events in the game real?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The game gives hypothetical choices but yes, the types of action, the pictures, audio, and references are all based on real life events (crazy right?!).</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Is civil rights over?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Discrimination is harder to detect now, as it’s no longer legal. Check out the 11 facts on discrimination to see the current state of racial problems in our country. It takes only a few individuals standing up to change things, so don’t hesitate to speak up when you see acts of discrimination in your community!</p>
