  <h4>What’s this game about?</h4>
  <div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">What is segregation? </h4>
  <div>
    <p>To get technical it’s the “separation of human beings into racial groups in daily life.” To put it simply, laws were used during the 20th century to keep groups separate and to discriminate against minority groups. These laws are no longer in place, but discrimination still exists. </p>
  </div>

  <h4>When did legal segregation end?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The Civil Rights Act of 1964 outlawed major forms of discrimination against racial, ethnic, gender, and religious groups, but it took many years of grassroots activism for these changes to actually happen. There are still many inequalities in housing, job opportunities, education, and health access for many minority groups that were born from the laws of the past.</p>

  <h4>Who is Dr. Martin Luther King and why does he have a holiday?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Martin Luther King Jr. is a famous leader of the Civil Rights Movement in the United States. He is best known for using non-violent civil disobedience (refusal to follow certain laws) to fight legal discrimination. He was ultimately assassinated at the age of 39 because of his beliefs and active fight for equality for all individuals.</p>
