    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>The Facts:</span></h3>
    <p>Hunger occurs in every county in America.</p>
    <p>The National School Lunch Program provided free or reduced-price lunches to about 31 million children each school day in 2012.</p>
    <p>In 2012, 6.2 million households received food from a food pantry or soup kitchen at least once.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What are some of the effects of hunger?</span></h3>
    <p>Without enough food to eat, children get sick more often. This could mean more stomachaches, headaches, and colds for those younger than 5. And compared to children with enough to eat, kids who experience hunger arenâ€™t able to do as well in school because concentrating is harder with a empty stomach.</p>
