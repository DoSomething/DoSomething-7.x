    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>More and more people are relying on food banks and pantries. Those programs need individual donations, like yours, to supply meals.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Why peanut butter?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Peanut butter is an item that is often requested by people coming to food pantries. It’s high in protein, has a long shelf life, and liked by many!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I want to participate but I’ve never done anything like this before. Help!</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We’ve got you covered! Check out <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/pbj14/step-by-step.pdf" target="_blank">our step-by-step guide</a> to collecting food in your community.</p> 
    </div>

    <h3>What’s the difference between a food bank and a food pantry?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>A food bank is an organization that receives, tracks, and distributes donated food and grocery products to organizations directly helping people in need, like food pantries, youth programs, senior centers, and homeless shelters. A food pantry is an organization that provides people with food and groceries to be eaten or prepared at home.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What happens after I drop off the food I collect at the food bank?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>After you drop off the collected food at your local food bank, the food is distributed to agencies. Agencies are community organizations like food pantries, youth programs, senior centers, day care centers, and homeless shelters that hand out the food to people in need.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>There’s a food pantry in my town. Can I drop off my items there?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Probably! Just make sure to call the pantry before you deliver the donation so the staff expect you!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I researched hunger and the term “food insecure” was used a lot. What does that mean?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Hunger is often described as "food insecurity." According to Feeding America, food insecurity means "a lack of access, at times, to enough nutritious food for an active, healthy life for all household members."</p>
    </div>

      <h3>How do I win the $7,500 scholarship?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The scholarship winner will be picked randomly. To enter the lottery, collect and drop off ten food items at your local food bank (or pantry). For every additional ten items, you’ll be entered to win again. There is no limit on the number of times you can enter. Don’t forget to <a href="//dosomething.org/pbj/report-back">tell us</a> about the items you collect -- that’s the only way we will know how many times to enter you into the lottery.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Can I collect other food items besides peanut butter?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yes! Peanut butter is one of the best items to donate, but food banks can always use donations. Other good items to collect are cereal, tuna, canned fruit, and canned vegetables. If you can, try and avoid collecting items in glass jars.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Where do I drop off the food I collect?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Find your local food bank by going <a href="#location" class="jump-scroll">here</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What is the deadline for PB &amp; Jam Slam?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>PB &amp; Jam Slam ends May 15th.</p>
    </div>

    <h3> If I collect other food items besides peanut butter, will those be counted toward scholarship entries?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yes! Collecting any 10 non-perishable food items will enter you into the lottery once. We encourage people to ask for peanut butter specifically because we know it's a super helpful item to donate.</p>
