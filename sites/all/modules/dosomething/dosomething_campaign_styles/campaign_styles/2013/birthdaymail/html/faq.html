    <h3>Why is this important?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> Everyone has a birthday, and if you’re like us, you probably love to celebrate yours! Unfortunately, for children experiencing homelessness, birthday celebrations might not be a top priority.  Creating and sending a birthday card to a shelter will help ensure everyone is celebrated on their special day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">What happened after cards were mailed?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Cards were received by a staff member at the shelter. This person would either fill out the card for the birthday boy or girl or pass the card along to friends and family to fill out the card. Either way, the card helped a child or teen celebrate their birthday!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Even though Birthday Mail is over, can I still send birthday cards to homeless shelters?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yea! To do so, search for a family or youth shelter in your area, call them to tell them about what you're doing, and then ask if they would like to receive cards from you.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What else can I do to help people experiencing homelessness?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>When people go to a shelter, they often need things such as socks, underwear, towels, and toiletries like toothbrushes, shampoo, and soap. You could also <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/action-tips-lead-games-homeless-children" target="_blank">lead games</a> for children. Call your local shelter to see what would be the most helpful.</p>
