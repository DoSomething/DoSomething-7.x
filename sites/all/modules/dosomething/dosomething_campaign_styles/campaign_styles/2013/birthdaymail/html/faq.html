    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> Everyone has a birthday, and if you’re like us, you probably love to celebrate yours! Unfortunately, for children experiencing homelessness, birthday celebrations might not be a top priority.  Creating and sending a birthday card to a shelter will help ensure everyone is celebrated on their special day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Why should I leave my card blank?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>By leaving your card blank, you’re letting someone close to the birthday boy or girl write a personal message. Your card + their message = a winning combination!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>If I'm making multiple cards, can I put them all in one envelope?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yes! Putting them all in one envelope will be easier for you and the staff at the shelter.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I’m having trouble coming up with an idea for my card. Help!</h3>
    <div>
      <p>For some creative card ideas, check out our <a href="//www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/birthdaymail/ActionGuide.pdf" target="_blank">action guides</a> here.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Can I deliver my cards to the shelter instead of mailing them?</h3>

    <div>
      <p>If you want to deliver your cards to a shelter on our list, it is important to call them first. They are only expecting cards via snail mail, so you need to make sure that personal delivery is acceptable! If you want to deliver cards to a shelter not on our list, first call them to ask if they would like to receive your cards. Then, ask if personal delivery is alright.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What happens after I send my card?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Your card will be received by a staff member at the shelter. This person will either fill out the card for the birthday boy or girl or pass the card along to friends and family to fill out the card. Either way, the card will help the child or teen celebrate their birthday!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>There’s a shelter in my town where I want to send my card. Can I send it there?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The shelters that are provided by DoSomething.org are already accepting and expecting birthday cards, but if you want to send your card to another shelter, you can. Just make sure to call the shelter before you send it to let the staff know what to expect!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I win the $4,000 scholarship?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The scholarship winner will be picked randomly. To enter the lottery, make and send one card. To be entered again, make two more cards. There is no limit on the number of times you can enter. Don’t forget to <a class="jump-scroll" href="#gallery" target="_blank">tell us</a> about the cards you make &mdash; that’s the only way we will know how many times to enter you into the lottery. Plus, when you report back your photos will appear in the <a class="jump-scroll" href="#gallery">gallery</a>.
    </div>

    <h3>I don’t live in the U.S., can I still participate?</h3>

    <div>
      <p>Yea! To do so, find a homeless shelter in your area, call them to tell them about what you are doing, and then ask if they would like to receive cards from you. If there isn’t a shelter in your area or country, feel free to choose any shelter on our list and mail your card(s) to the U.S.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What else can I do to help people experiencing homelessness?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>When people go to a shelter, they often need things such as socks, underwear, towels, and toiletries like toothbrushes, shampoo, and soap. You could also <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/action-tips-lead-games-homeless-children" target="_blank">lead games</a> for children. Call your local shelter to see what would be the most helpful.</p>
    </div>
