    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Some Tips:</span></h3>
    <p>1. Remember, you don’t know who will be receiving your card, so it’s best to <strong>make sure that your card could be enjoyed by anyone</strong> (of any age or gender). </p>

    <p>2. <strong>Leave the inside of the card blank</strong> so that someone close to the birthday boy or girl can fill it out. </p>

    <p>3. <strong>Be sure that the card is something that you would want</strong> to receive on your own birthday! </p>

    <p>4. <strong>Get creative!</strong> For some card ideas, check out our <a href="//www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/birthdaymail/ActionGuide.pdf" target="_blank">action guide</a>!</p>
