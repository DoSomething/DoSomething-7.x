  <p>Put yourself in the shoes of people running from persecution and violence and coming here for a safe haven. Don't deny them safety. &mdash; Jaren</p>

  <p>I went through the Undocumented for a Day experience and my eyes were opened. I was raised to think that "illegal immigrants" are bad, but now I can see how wrong I was. Everyone deserves equal opportunity. The same chance at a job as everyone else. I am documented but I believe that everyone needs the same chance. We are all endowed unalienable rights from our creator among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness &mdash; Anonymous</p>


  <p>We are all human, there no such thing as illegal humans. We all share this planet, we should treat everyone with the same respect.  &mdash; Erin</p>

  <p>It's a pressing issue that requires deep thought and an open mind and we need bipartisan corporation to solve the issue  &mdash; William</p>

  <p>Congress needs to address the issue head on. Life is hard for undocumented immigrants, and they just want to live the life that you and I take for granted. &mdash; Anonymous</p>

  <p>This country was founded by immigrants done hundred years ago . So to now deny other immigrants from following in your footsteps it highly hypocritical  &mdash; Anonymous</p>

  <p>Everyone should be allowed citizenship. To work hard and get what they earn. Immigrants are what made America, let's not change that.  &mdash; Marques</p>

  <p>I would say that they should be more open when it comes to immigrants. I understand that they are strict because they don't want to allow "bad" people to our country but a lot of those "bad" people are only trying to have a better future. Every person deserves that right, even if they were not born in America.  &mdash; Martha</p>

  <p>As an undocumented immigrant myself, I've lived through the struggle to try to lead a normal live, without any guarantee that all my hard work will someday pay off. Comprehensive immigration reform is no longer a dream it's a necessity. &mdash; Emma</p>
