  <h2>Erika Andiola</h2>
  <p>Erika is a nationally recognized leader in the undocumented immigrant youth movement and is a graduate of Arizona State University. To escape domestic violence, her mother moved her family from Mexico to Arizona when she was 11 years old. Erika faced many hardships because of her undocumented status, and lived with constant fear of losing her family to deportation proceedings. When Immigration and Customs Enforcement raided her home and took her mother and older brother, Erika’s case became nationally known when she mobilized hundreds of thousands of people using social media to stop their deportations. Inspired to take a stand for her fellow undocumented peers, she’s currently the co-founder of DRM Action Coalition and the Arizona Dream Act Coalition (ADAC).</p>

  <h2>Jose Machado</h2>
  <p>Jose came to the U.S. from Nicaragua at 6 years old on a visa with his twin brother. His mother was in a domestically violent relationship, and wanted to escape for a better life. She was stopped and detained while living in the U.S. for driving without a drivers license, and deported. Jose was in foster care from that point on, and was able to apply for residency. He is now a graduating senior at Miami Senior High. Although he feels privileged to have gained status, he wishes it was not at the expense of losing the person he loves the most--his mother. He wishes she was able to attend his graduation ceremony in June. Jose wants people to understand his experience but says, "This is my story, but I am the face of 11 million more like me."</p>

  <h2>Pierre Berastain</h2>
  <p>Pierre R. Berastaín was born in Lima, Peru and immigrated with his family to Dallas, Texas after eleven years of socio-economic hardships. His parents held University degrees, but were forced to work low-paying jobs moving furniture and mopping floors. Pierre excelled in school, but was placed in lower level classes because of misperceptions about his background and status. He learned early on that advocating for himself and his family would be crucial to their survival. Pierre applied to many universities, knowing his unlawful immigration status might create obstacles. He received acceptance to Harvard University and holds a B.A. in Social Anthropology from Harvard College, and is currently a Master of Divinity (M.Div.) candidate at Harvard Divinity School. Pierre wants to pursue a career in social justice, focusing on fighting domestic violence and states, "I want to be defined by my work in domestic violence, in the LGBT community, and with the underprivileged in the Boston community. I don’t want my undocumented status to become my final status."</p>
