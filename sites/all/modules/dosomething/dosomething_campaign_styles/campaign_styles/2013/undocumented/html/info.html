  <h2>The Problem</h2>
  <p>Undocumented immigrants move to the U.S. to escape to violence, war, and poverty, but have no path to becoming legal residents and citizens. This leaves 11 million people who currently live here with limited options to create a life for themselves and their family.</p>

  <h2>The Game</h2>
  <p>Imagine moving to the U.S. at a young age to escape hardship, only to be labeled an "alien", "freeloader", or worse, no matter how hard you work. Imagine living in fear of being sent back to a country that’s dangerous for you, or working hard to graduate High School, but having few options of where to go. That’s the daily reality for millions of young people who are undocumented, and some of the experiences you will see in this game.</p>

  <h2>What You Can Do</h2>
  <p>You have the power to change 11 million lives by sharing this game. You’ll help people see how difficult and unfair life as an undocumented immigrant can be, and why we need to change this. Then <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/petition/immigration">sign our petition</a> which supports one of the most historic policies on immigration in decades. </p>
