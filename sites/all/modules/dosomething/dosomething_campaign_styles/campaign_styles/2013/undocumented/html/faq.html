  <h4>What’s this game about?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>This game walks you through a day in the life of an undocumented student about to graduate high school, and is based on real life situations. By playing this game, you’ll see for yourself what it means to be undocumented.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There’s SO much conversation around immigration, and what it means to be a citizen in the United States. The media, government officials, teachers, and probably your parents have opinions on immigrants and immigration in this country. This game will show you the real story.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">What does the term undocumented immigrant actually mean?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The term undocumented immigrant means someone who is not able to become a legal resident of the U.S. Our immigration system is extremely difficult to navigate, and biased towards various countries. Many immigrants move from their home country to reunite with their family, escape war torn environments, or create a new life, but it’s nearly impossible for many of them to gain legal status through our current system.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What’s the difference between a Legal Resident and U.S. Citizen?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>A legal resident is someone who has a green card, which gives them the right to live and work in the U.S. on a permanent basis, but a green card holder cannot do everything a U.S. citizen can. They cannot vote, remain outside the U.S. for unlimited amounts of time, and they can lose their residency rights for failing to follow various rules of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Many immigrants are unable to obtain even a green card. Undocumented immigrants are given few options to create a productive life or protect their family from harm.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why should I participate?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Undocumented immigrants have stories that aren’t being heard. They live, love, work and dream as anyone else in this country would. Our system is broken. We can fix this. We can show the value in all human beings, no matter their origin, background, or country. Play this game, and share it with as many friends as you can. You’ll open other people’s eyes and take a stand by <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/petition/immigration">signing a petition</a> to support changing our immigration system.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What’s this talk about immigration reform?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>That’s a fancy way of saying we’re going to fix how people can move and become a legal resident of the U.S. Remember, EVERY family has some sort of immigration story. Without immigration, this country wouldn’t be what it is today.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What can I do?</h4>
  <div>
    <p><b>Share the game</b>: By sharing this game with <a href="#game" class="jump_scroll">six friends</a>, you will push the real story forward of immigrants and why their lives matter.</p>
    <br>
    <p><b>Sign the petition</b>: There’s a major bill which will be voted on by the Senate <b>this June</b> called The Border Security and Economic Opportunity Act (say that three times fast). This bill provides major changes to our immigration system, providing a path to legal residency for 11 million immigrants who currently don’t have one. If we don’t pass this bill, millions of young people can’t work, live, or contribute to society. <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/petition/immigration">Sign this petition</a> to put pressure on all U.S. state senators to vote in favor of this bill.</p>
  </div>
