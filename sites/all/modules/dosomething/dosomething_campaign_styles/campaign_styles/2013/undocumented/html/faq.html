  <h4>What's this experience about?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>This text message experience walked people through a day in the life of an undocumented student about to graduate high school, and was based on real life situations.</p>
    <br>
    <p>There’s SO much conversation around immigration, and what it means to be a citizen in the United States. The media, government officials, teachers, and probably your parents have opinions on immigrants and immigration in this country. This experience showed some of the real experiences undocumented immigrants go through.</p>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">What does the term undocumented immigrant actually mean?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The term undocumented immigrant means someone who is not able to become a legal resident of the U.S. Our immigration system is extremely difficult to navigate, and biased towards various countries. Many immigrants move from their home country to reunite with their family, escape war torn environments, or create a new life, but it’s nearly impossible for many of them to gain legal status through our current system.</p>

  <h4>What’s the difference between a Legal Resident and U.S. Citizen?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>A legal resident is someone who has a green card, which gives them the right to live and work in the U.S. on a permanent basis, but a green card holder cannot do everything a U.S. citizen can. They cannot vote, remain outside the U.S. for unlimited amounts of time, and they can lose their residency rights for failing to follow various rules of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. Many immigrants are unable to obtain even a green card. Undocumented immigrants are given few options to create a productive life or protect their family from harm.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What’s this talk about immigration reform?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>That’s a fancy way of saying we’re going to fix how people can move and become a legal resident of the U.S. Remember, EVERY family has some sort of immigration story. Without immigration, this country wouldn’t be what it is today.</p>

  <h4>What should I do if I know someone who is undocumented or if I’m undocumented?</h4>
