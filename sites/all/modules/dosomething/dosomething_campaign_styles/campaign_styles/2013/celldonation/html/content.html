    <p>Homelessness is an issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>The Facts</span></h3>
    <p>Each year, about 3 million people in the U.S. find themselves homeless.</p>
    <p>Families make up 40% of the homeless population.</p>
    <p>Approximately 1 in 3 people experiencing homelessness is under the age of 18 and 1 in 6 people is under the age of 6.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What are some of the effects of homelessness?</span></h3>
    <p>The effects of homelessness are different for each person. Children who experience homelessness are more likely to experience hunger, get sick, and miss school than other children. Homelessness also takes away many things we often donâ€™t think about -- a place to get ready for school, a door with a lock, an address, and the ability to have a friend over for a playdate.</p>
