    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Learn the Issue</span></h2>

    <p>Homelessness is an issue that affects people of all ages and backgrounds.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>The Facts</span></h3>
    <p>Each year, about 3 million people in the U.S. find themselves homeless.</p>
    <p>Families make up 40% of the homeless population.</p>
    <p>Approximately 1 in 3 people experiencing homelessness is under the age of 18 and 1 in 6 people is under the age of 6.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What are some of the effects of homelessness?</span></h3>
    <p>The effects of homelessness are different for each person. Children who experience homelessness are more likely to experience hunger, get sick, and miss school than other children. Homelessness also takes away many things we often don’t think about -- a place to get ready for school, a door with a lock, an address, and the ability to have a friend over for a playdate.</p>

  <div class="faq">
    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Frequently Asked Questions:</span></h2>

    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> Everyone has a birthday, and if you’re like us, you probably love to celebrate yours! Unfortunately, for children experiencing homelessness, birthday celebrations might not be a top priority.  Creating and sending a birthday card to a shelter will help ensure everyone is celebrated on their special day.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Why should I leave my card blank?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>By leaving your card blank, you’re letting someone close to the birthday boy or girl write a personal message. Your card + their message = a winning combination!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I’m having trouble coming up with an idea for my card. Help!</h3>
    <div>
      <p>For some creative card ideas, check out our <a href="#" target="_blank">action guides</a> here.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What happens after I send my card?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Your card will be received by a staff member at the shelter. This person will either fill out the card for the birthday boy or girl or pass the card along to friends and family to fill out the card. Either way, the card will help the child or teen celebrate their birthday!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>There’s a shelter in my town where I want to send my card. Can I send it there?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The shelters that are provided by DoSomething.org are already accepting and expecting birthday cards, but if you want to send your card to another shelter, you can. Just make sure to call the shelter before you send it to let the staff know what to expect!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I win the $4,000 scholarship?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The scholarship winner will be picked randomly. To enter the lottery, make and send one card. To be entered again, make two more cards. There is no limit on the number of times you can enter. Don’t forget to <a class="jump-scroll" href="#gallery" target="_blank">tell us</a> about the cards you make &emdash; that’s the only way we will know how many times to enter you into the lottery. Plus, when you report back your photos will appear in the <a class="jump-scroll" href="#gallery">gallery</a>.
    </div>

    <h3>What else can I do to help people experiencing homelessness?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>When people go to a shelter, they often need things such as socks, underwear, towels, and toiletries like toothbrushes, shampoo, and soap. You could also <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/actnow/actionguide/action-tips-lead-games-homeless-children" target="_blank">lead games</a> for children. Call your local shelter to see what would be the most helpful.</p>
    </div>
