   <h2>Words From A Shelter</h2>
   <p>Your donation of hundreds of good quality jeans was FANTASTIC! As you all know, there is a great need in the community for donated clothing for men, women, and especially children. It is through the efforts of caring individuals and organizations like yours that these needs can be met. Wearing clean, good quality clothing improves an individual's self-image, which in turn improves their quality of life and enables them to take the next step forward.</p>
