    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> When people enter a homeless shelter, they often don’t have more than the clothes they are wearing. Jeans are often requested because they provide a sense of normalcy, can be worn for several days before they need to washed, and are comfortable during every season.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">What happens after I drop off my jeans at my local A&eacute;ropostale store?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Each A&eacute;ropostale and P.S. from A&eacute;ropostale store is paired with at least one homeless shelter in your community. In total, over 1,000 homeless shelters across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico are participating in Teens for Jeans 2014.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I get involved?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Sign up to run a jeans drive at your school. Then spread the word, collect gently worn jeans, and visit your local Aéropostale or P.S. from Aéropostale store to drop off what you collect. For each pair you drop off, you will receive a coupon for 25% off a new pair of jeans!</p>
