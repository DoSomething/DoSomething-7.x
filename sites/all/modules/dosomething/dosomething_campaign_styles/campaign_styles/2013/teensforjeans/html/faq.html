    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> When people enter a homeless shelter, they often don’t have more than the clothes they are wearing. Jeans are often requested because they provide a sense of normalcy, can be worn for several days before they need to washed, and are comfortable during every season.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">What happens after I drop off my jeans at my local A&eacute;ropostale store?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Each A&eacute;ropostale and P.S. from A&eacute;ropostale store is paired with at least one homeless shelter or charity in your community. In total, almost 1,000 organizations across the U.S., Canada, and Puerto Rico are participating in Teens for Jeans 2014.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I get involved?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Sign up to run a jeans drive at your school. Then spread the word, collect gently worn jeans, and visit your local Aéropostale or P.S. from Aéropostale store to drop off what you collect. For each pair you drop off, you will receive a coupon for 25% off a new pair of jeans!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I get a coupon for 25% off a new pair of jeans?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Bring your jeans into your local A&eacute;ropostale or P.S. from A&eacute;ropostale store -- you'll get one coupon for each pair of jeans you donate.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I have to drop off the jeans all at once or can I drop them off throughout the campaign?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>You can bring in your jeans all at once or throughout the campaign. The stores aren't able to keep track of who donated jeans -- so you can tell us about your drive by going <a href="/teensforjeans/report-back">here</a> or by texting PHOTO to 38383 and following the instructions -- so be sure to keep count of your jeans and report back once you're done collecting!</p>
    </div>

    </div>

    <h3>Can more than one person working on the same drive enter to win the scholarship?</h3>
    <div>

can be achieved by Stashing the Edvisor offer id on the campaign and
using a a standardize (but themable) webform confirmation page.
