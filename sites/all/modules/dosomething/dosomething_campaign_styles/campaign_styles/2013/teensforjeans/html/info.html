    <p class="centered">Want to run the best jeans drive ever? Check out these tips:</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Spread the Word</span></h3>
    <ul class="teens-bullets">
      <li><span>Post details about your drive on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.</span></li>
      <li><span><a href="/sites/all/modules/dosomething/dosomething_campaign_styles/campaign_styles/2013/teensforjeans/assets/drive-poster.png" target="_blank">Put up posters</a> in your school and community.</span></li>
      <li><span>Include information in your school's newsletter, and ask about making an announcement over your school's PA system.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Be Strategic</span></h3>
    <ul class="teens-bullets">
      <li><span>Set up your drive in a place where a lot of people will see it, like in front of your school's office or in the entrance of your church.</span></li>
      <li><span>Add a sign explaining who the jeans will be donated to, how long the box will be there, and who someone should contact with questions.</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Make It a Team Effort</span></h3>
    <ul class="teens-bullets">
      <li><span>Ask your teachers if donating jeans could count as extra credit or a couple of extra points on the next pop quiz.</span></li>
      <li><span>Is there a school dance coming up? Find out if donating a pair of jeans could pay for a ticket!</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Set a School Goal</span></h3>
    <ul class="teens-bullets">
      <li><span>Setting a goal helps everyone understand just how much they are contributing to the cause. Plus, you can make getting to the goal really fun!</span></li>
      <li><span>Have teachers, staff, and faculty promise to do crazy things at the quarter, half-way, and three quater marks. Would they be willing to wear a crazy t-shirt to work? Shave their head? Dance at the next school assembly?</span></li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Shout Out</span></h3>
    <ul class="teens-bullets">
      <li><span>When classmates drop their jeans in the drive box, take their picture. Shout out that they donated on marketing flyers.</span></li>
      <li><span>Take an old t-shirt and write the details of the drive (where, when, that you're collecting jeans) on the front and back with a permanent marker. Let those who have donated sign it!</span></li>
    </ul>
