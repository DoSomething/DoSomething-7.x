    <h3>Where did my donated jeans go?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>We match each Aéropostale store to the nearest homeless shelter or charity that serves youth and would like to participate. The store ships all the jeans dropped off to their charity partner. Usually, the organization is within 30 miles of the store.</p>

can be achieved by Stashing the Edvisor offer id on the campaign and
using a a standardize (but themable) webform confirmation page.
