    <h3>Why did we do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Senior Citizens frequently fight depression due to isolation. After the holidays and families return home, this isolation is maximized.  We helped brighten the day of seniors across the country by sending them a Valentines Day card.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Why did we send cards to Meals on Wheels?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Meals on Wheels provides over one million meals to senior citizens each day. Their goals are to help seniors maintain independence as they age and enable them to live in their own homes. Meals on Wheels programs across the country are able to hand deliver your cards to senior citizens nationwide. <!-- Find a program to send your card to here. --></p>

      <h3>How is the $4,000 scholarship winner chosen?</h3>

      <p>The scholarship winner is picked randomly. To enter the lottery, participants made and sent a card. To be entered again, participants made three more cards. There was no limit on the number of entries.</p>
