    <p class="center">No problem! Older adults at senior centers are always looking to learn new forms of technology.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Find a Senior Center Near You</span></h3>
    <p>The easiest way to find a local senior center is to search online for your town + “senior center” or “nursing home.” Usually a phone number/address will pop up.</p>
    <p>If you don’t get any results that way, try contacting your town officials or places of worship (like churches or synagogues) to get info. You can also <a target="_blank" href="http://www.eldercare.gov/eldercare.net/public/resources/topic/Volunteerism.aspx">try to find your local senior center through your local Department of Aging</a>.</p>
