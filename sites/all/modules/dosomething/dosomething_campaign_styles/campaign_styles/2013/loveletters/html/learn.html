    <ol>
        <li>A lack of social connections (which can be re-phrased as loneliness or isolation) is as comparable a risk factor for early death as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and is worse for individuals than other well-known risk factors such as obesity and physical inactivity.</li>
        <li>An estimated 6 percent of people ages 65 and older in a given year, or approximately 2 million individuals in this age group, have a diagnosable depressive illness.</li>
        <li>The rate of depression rises when in home healthcare or hospitalization is required. Depression rates rise to 13.5% in those who require home healthcare and to 11.5% in older hospital patients.</li>
        <li>1 in 6 seniors don't know where their next meal will come from. Thatâ€™s why they have Meals on Wheels! </li>
