  <h4>Do the supplies have to be new?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Yes, ideally all of the supplies should be unused. Having something fresh and new can be really powerful when what is surrounding you is all dirty and broken.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Do I have to send all of those supplies?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Nope! You can send one or all of the things on the <a href="#list" class="jump_scroll">list</a> above.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Do I have to send a note with my supplies?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Only send a note if you want to. Sending a quick message saying “We’re thinking about you.” or “You’re in my thoughts.” can be therapeutic to give and receive, so we wanted to offer the option.  If you’d rather send a message through your phone, text HOPE to 38383.</p>
