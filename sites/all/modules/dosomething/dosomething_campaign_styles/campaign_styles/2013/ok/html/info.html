  <p class="center">After traumatic experiences, young kids sometimes have a hard time processing what they’ve been through.  In these instances, art can help them work through their grief in a creative way, starting the healing process.</p>

  <h2>WHAT IS ART FEEDS</h2>
  <p><a href="#">Art Feeds</a> is on the ground working to bring healing through art to young people recovering from disaster. They’re working now to bring their programs to Moore, OK.  Art Feeds is based out of Joplin, MO and conducts mobile programs with elementary students who have undergone trauma and overcome obstacles. The programs use therapeutic art and creative education that comes free of cost to the participating students and schools. Their programs and processes are created to facilitate healing as well as cognitive and developmental growth. </p>
