  <h4>Why Should I do this?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Puppy mills are a dirty secret in the pet store world. Virtually all pets sold in pet stores or online are from puppy mills and buying from them supports these terrible practices. If you love puppies, the best way to fight for them is encourage your friends not to shop at pet stores that sell pets. The Puppy Text will provide them with a pet store near them that offers adoptions so they can feel good about where they get their pet supplies.</p>
