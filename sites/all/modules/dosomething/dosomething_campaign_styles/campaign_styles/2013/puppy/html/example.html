  <p>Puppy text is a choose-your-own adventure game where you play a pet store employee who must choose whether to stand up against animal abuse or turn a blind eye to make a profit.</p>

  <div class="play-how">
	  <p class="bubble-left">A customer comes in looking for a pug. Do you SELL them one or refer them to a SHELTER?</p>
	  <p class="bubble-right">SELL</p>
	  <p class="bubble-left">You get a promotion! Youâ€™re now the head of dogs. But why are they arriving in sketchy giant trucks? Choose to ask your BOSS or IGNORE it.</p>
