  <p>Puppy text is a choose-your-own adventure game where you play a pet store employee who must choose whether to stand up against animal abuse or turn a blind eye to make a profit.</p>

  <div class="play-how">
	  <p class="bubble-left">It's your first day of work at Fur Real Pet Store. A customer asks whether he should buy from you or adopt from a shelter. What do you tell her? Text SELL or SHELTER</p>
	  <p class="bubble-right">SELL</p>
	  <p class="bubble-left">Sold! Now the store needs more puppies. But why are they coming in an 18-wheeler truck? Choose to ask your BOSS or be QUIET</p>
