  <h2>WHAT IS A PUPPY MILL?</h2>
  <p>A puppy mill is a large-scale commercial dog breeding operation where making money is given priority over the health of the dogs.</p>

	<p>What does this mean? Unlike responsible breeders, who care deeply about the health of their animals, puppy mill operators often fail to apply proper pet care practices. This means sickness and infections are common, both in the puppies that are sold to stores and the mother dogs who live in overcrowded, dirty conditions their whole lives.</p>
