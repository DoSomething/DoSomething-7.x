  <h2>WHAT IS A PUPPY MILL?</h2>
  <p>A puppy mill is a dog-breeding factory where the health of the dogs is disregarded to keep costs down and maximize profits. The dogs live in their own waste in tiny cages with painful wire flooring. They have no access to veterinarians so disease and infection is common. Puppies are taken away from their mothers when they’re only weeks old.</p>

  <h2>HOW BIG IS THE PROBLEM?</h2>
  <p>Virtually all the 500,000 pets sold in pet stores each year come from mills. These are only the ones that survive -- millions of puppies are born in puppy mills but don’t make it out alive.</p>
