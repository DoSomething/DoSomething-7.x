  <p>&ldquo;I've always been interested in volunteering with my local animal shelter. I've also had the opportunity of volunteering with the National Honor Society in high school and am starting to volunteer with the Habitat for Humanity, an organization I joined at my university this fall. I am involved with DoSomething.org through their different campaigns and awareness raised with their varied causes. I plan on graduating with my masters degree in social work, which will allow me to pursue child advocacy and other career paths associated with the welfare of my community. And if I was a crayola crayon color, I would be blue.&rdquo; &mdash; Alison</p>
