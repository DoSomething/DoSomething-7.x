	<p>"I was drawn to DoSomething.org's Recycling Cause because my family has been recycling for as long as I can remember. What I have noticed on our weekly runs to the center is that we create three times as much recycling as we do trash. Imagine the impact it would have on the environment if every family in America cut their waste by 75% by just separating out recyclable materials! I plan to study engineering because with the knowledge I gain I hope to affect my community for the better."</p>
