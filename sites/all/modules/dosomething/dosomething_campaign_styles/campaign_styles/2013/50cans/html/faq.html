  <h3 class="active">How do I win the scholarship?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The scholarship winner will be randomly selected from all the eligible entries. To qualify, run a drive to collect and recycle empty aluminum cans. Take a photo of all the cans you collect and upload it either here or on instagram. For instagram, tag us and  use the hashtag #50cans + how many cans you collected (so like: @dosomething #50cans 400). Every fifty cans gets you another chance at winning the scholarship.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Why should I recycle aluminum cans?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>The aluminum can is one of the most valuable recyclable consumer products and the only packaging solution that allows for complete recyclability. Recycled aluminum cans can be back on the store shelf in as little as 60 days and require 95% less energy, generate 95% less emission and create 97% less water pollution than producing the new metal from ore. An aluminum can is incredibly valuable; the industry estimates that, in the United States, nearly 50 billion aluminum cans are thrown away annually; that's $800 million annually being buried in American landfills.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>What's the difference between the recycling process of aluminum cans versus paper or plastic bottles?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Aluminum is one of the most reusable sources available and can be used over and over and over again indefinitely. Two very commonly recycled materials, paper (because of the fibers) and plastic (because of its molecular structure), are limited in the number of times they can be recycled, and the quality eventually degrades to a non-reusable state.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Do I have to submit a photo for every 50 cans I collect?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Nope, one photo is perfect! Just let us know how many cans are in the picture and we’ll do the math.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Where can I recycle my cans?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>If you know  of a recycling center near you, you can drop them off there. Don’t know where to go? Enter your zip code in our <a href="#location-finder">Location Finder</a> to find one near you.</p>
  </div>

@todo - Ideally this will be handled in a more automated fashion.  This
can be achieved by Stashing the Edvisor offer id on the campaign and
using a a standardize (but themable) webform confirmation page.
@todo - add a http referrer check as well
