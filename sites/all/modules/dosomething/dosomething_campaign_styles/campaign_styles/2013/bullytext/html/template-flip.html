    <img src="http://www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/bullytext/Edrina.jpg" alt="Edrina">
    <p>"The Bully Text was particularly important to me because I have been personally affected by it, my cousin was constantly bullied in school and I remember how she would be scared to go to school because of bullies and NO ONE should ever be scared to go to school, we're there to get an education. In sending these Bully Text I felt I contributed a bit of help to raise awareness anything really helps even a simple text."</p>

    <h2 class="section-header"><span>How To Step Up To Bullying</span></h2>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Be A Friend</span></h3>
      <p>If you see someone being bullied, reach out to him. Invite him to hang out, sit with him at lunch, or just ask him how he's doing and listen to him.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Speak Up</span></h3>
      <p>If someone says something you don't think is cool and you feel safe, say something to him. It's not about starting a fight - it's about telling him you don't think what he's doing is right.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Help him get out of the situation</span></h3>
      <p>If you feel safe, you can help give the bullied a way out by saying "hey man, we're going to be late for class" or a similar statement. Or, you can create a distraction - bullying will often stop if the attention shifts elsewhere. Just remember to never put yourself in a situation where you feel threatened or in danger.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Tell an old person</span></h3>
      <p>If you see bullying in your school, alert a teacher, principal or guidance counselor. The more they understand the bullying climate in their school, the better they can adjust the school policy to make it a better place.</p>
