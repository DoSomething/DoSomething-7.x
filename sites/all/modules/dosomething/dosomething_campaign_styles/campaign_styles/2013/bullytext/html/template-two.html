    <h2 class="section-header"><span>How To Step Up To Bullying</span></h2>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Be A Friend</span></h3>
      <p>If you see someone being bullied, reach out to him. Invite him to hang out, sit with him at lunch, or just ask him how he's doing and listen to him.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Speak Up</span></h3>
      <p>If someone says something you don't think is cool and you feel safe, say something to him. It's not about starting a fight - it's about telling him you don't think what he's doing is right.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Help him get out of the situation</span></h3>
      <p>If you feel safe, you can help give the bullied a way out by saying "hey man, we're going to be late for class" or a similar statement. Or, you can create a distraction - bullying will often stop if the attention shifts elsewhere. Just remember to never put yourself in a situation where you feel threatened or in danger.</p>

      <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Tell an old person</span></h3>
      <p>If you see bullying in your school, alert a teacher, principal or guidance counselor. The more they understand the bullying climate in their school, the better they can adjust the school policy to make it a better place.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>

    <h3>What is The Bully Text?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> The Bully Text is a text messaging experience set during the first day of your new school (virtual school, in this case).  As you play the game, you’ll be taken through different scenarios where you encounter bullying, either as the victim, the bully or a bystander.  How you respond to the situation affects the rest of your day, either giving you an epic win or the chance to try and respond to the sitautions differently.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How long is The Bully Text?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>It’s up to you.  You can stop the experience at any time, or you can try as many paths as possible.  You choose your own path.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">How many text messages will I get?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>It depends on how far in the experience you make it.  You can stop at any time, or keep encountering different situations to respond to.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>You’ll get a text with a situation, and you’ll get one or two choices in ALL CAPS.  Choose your next path by responding with the keyword that is in ALL CAPS and you’ll go to the next level.  For example, if it says “Do you go to LUNCH or HOME,” you can respond HOME or LUNCH and you’ll be taken to the next level.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I have to pay for texts?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Your standard messaging and data rates apply. We never ask you for money - all of the texts you get from us we do not ask you to pay for. However, if your plan charges you for texts that you receive or send, then those rates would still apply.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Wait! You didn't answer my question!</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Sorry about that! Email Alyssa at <a href="mailto:BullyText@DoSomething.org">BullyText@DoSomething.org</a> and she'll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
