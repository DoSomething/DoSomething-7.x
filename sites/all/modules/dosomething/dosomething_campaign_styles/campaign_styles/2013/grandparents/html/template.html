    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Don’t know any older adults?</span></h2>

    <p>No problem! Older adults at senior centers are always looking to learn new forms of technology.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Find a Senior Center Near You</span></h3>
    <p>The easiest way to find a local senior center is to search online for your town + “senior center” or “nursing home.” Usually a phone number/address will pop up.</p>
    <p>If you don’t get any results that way, try contacting your town officials or places of worship (like churches or synagogues) to get info. You can also try to <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/eldercare.net/public/resources/topic/Volunteerism.aspx">find your local senior center</a> through your local Department of Aging.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Don’t Know What to Say When You Call?</span></h3>
    <p>Use this script to help you explain what you’d like to do. Having trouble connecting with a senior center? Email Sarah at <a href="mailto:grandparents@dosomething.org">grandparents@dosomething.org</a></p>

    <p><em>Hey! My name is _______. I’m a DoSomething.org member and I’m participating in the Grandparents Gone Wired campaign this year.</em></p>
    <p><em>DoSomething.org is a national non-profit that helps young adults take action on causes they care about, including helping older adults get connected to technology through their Grandparents Gone Wired campaign.</em></p>
    <p><em>Do you have a volunteer program where I can help older adults get connected to technology? If not, is there a time I can schedule to come in and help people who are interested?</em></p>
    <p><em>I have resources to help me teach different types of technology. Please let me know if you need me to bring anything else.</em></p>
    <p><em>Grandparents Gone Wired runs from October 22nd to January 3rd, 2014.</em></p>
    <p><em>You can reach me at _______ (phone number) or ________ (email).</em></p>
    <p><em>Thank you!</em></p>
    

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What You Can Do</span></h3>
    <p>By participating you'll do two things: 1) <a href="#headline" class="jump-scroll">help others</a> understand the crazy working conditions poor women face and 2) select a female entrepreneur to receive a $25 Kiva loan. This loan can change her life and her community — that's more than cool, we think that's pretty awesome.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>

    <h3>What is Grandparents Gone Wired?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Grandparents Gone Wired urges young people to share their tech knowledge with their grandparents or older adults in their community to help the older adult learn to use new forms of technology and stay connected with friends and family.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">How does this work?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>First, pick a type of technology (link to tech section) you’d like to teach to an older adult. Get together with that person, and follow the teaching tips for that particular technology. Report back (link to report back) with a photo of you and the older adult using the technology and you’ll be entered to win the $4,000 scholarship.</p>

      <p>You can also enter to win other sweet prizes. <a class="jump-scroll" href="#prizes">Check out the challenges above</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I have to teach every type of technology to an older adult?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Absolutely not! It’s important not only to make sure you are comfortable teaching the technology, but that the older adult wants to learn it as well. Make sure you take time to ask them what they’d most like to do (check email, talk to people over video chat, send text messages, etc.). Then you can check out the specific teaching tips for each section.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to teach a form of technology that’s not on our website, go for it! Email Sarah at <a href="mailto:grandparents@dosomething.org">grandparents@dosomething.org</a> if you have any questions.</p>

      <p>And remember, to enter to win the $4,000, <a href="//dosomething.org/grandparents/report-back">report back</a> with a photo of you and the older adult learning the technology.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What if I don’t know any older adults?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>No problem! Older adults at senior centers are always looking for ways to learn new technology.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to find a local senior center is to search online for your town + “senior center” or “nursing home.” Usually a phone number/address will pop up.</p>

      <p>If you don’t get any results that way, try contacting your town officials or places of worship (like churches or synagogues) to get info. You can also try to <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/eldercare.net/public/resources/topic/Volunteerism.aspx">find your local senior center</a> through your local Department of Aging.</p>

    <h3>Who is Mentor Up?</h3>
    <div>
      <p><a href="//www.mentorup.org">Mentor Up</a> is a new way to make a difference from AARP Foundation that brings together the younger generation's energy and talents to pursue reverse mentoring and community service opportunities that help people 50 and older.</p>
