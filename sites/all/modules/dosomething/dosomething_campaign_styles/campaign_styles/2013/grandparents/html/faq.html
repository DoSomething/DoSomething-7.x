    <h3>What is Grandparents Gone Wired?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Grandparents Gone Wired urges young people to share their tech knowledge with their grandparents or older adults in their community to help the older adult learn to use new forms of technology and stay connected with friends and family.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">How does this work?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>First, pick a type of technology (link to tech section) you’d like to teach to an older adult. Get together with that person, and follow the teaching tips for that particular technology. Report back (link to report back) with a photo of you and the older adult using the technology and you’ll be entered to win the $4,000 scholarship.</p>

      <p>You can also enter to win other sweet prizes. <a class="jump-scroll" href="#prizes">Check out the challenges above</a>.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I have to teach every type of technology to an older adult?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Absolutely not! It’s important not only to make sure you are comfortable teaching the technology, but that the older adult wants to learn it as well. Make sure you take time to ask them what they’d most like to do (check email, talk to people over video chat, send text messages, etc.). Then you can check out the specific teaching tips for each section.</p>

      <p>If you’d like to teach a form of technology that’s not on our website, go for it! Email Sarah at <a href="mailto:grandparents@dosomething.org">grandparents@dosomething.org</a> if you have any questions.</p>

      <p>And remember, to enter to win the $4,000, <a href="//dosomething.org/grandparents/report-back">report back</a> with a photo of you and the older adult learning the technology.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What if I don’t know any older adults?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>No problem! Older adults at senior centers are always looking for ways to learn new technology.</p>

      <p>The easiest way to find a local senior center is to search online for your town + “senior center” or “nursing home.” Usually a phone number/address will pop up.</p>

      <p>If you don’t get any results that way, try contacting your town officials or places of worship (like churches or synagogues) to get info. You can also try to <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/eldercare.net/public/resources/topic/Volunteerism.aspx">find your local senior center</a> through your local Department of Aging.</p>
