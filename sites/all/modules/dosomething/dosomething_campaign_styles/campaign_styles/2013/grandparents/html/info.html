    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Don’t know any older adults?</span></h2>

    <p>No problem! Older adults at senior centers are always looking to learn new forms of technology.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Find a Senior Center Near You</span></h3>
    <p>The easiest way to find a local senior center is to search online for your town + “senior center” or “nursing home.” Usually a phone number/address will pop up.</p>
    <p>If you don’t get any results that way, try contacting your town officials or places of worship (like churches or synagogues) to get info. You can also try to <a href="http://www.eldercare.gov/eldercare.net/public/resources/topic/Volunteerism.aspx">find your local senior center</a> through your local Department of Aging.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Don’t Know What to Say When You Call?</span></h3>
    <p>Use this script to help you explain what you’d like to do. Having trouble connecting with a senior center? Email Sarah at <a href="mailto:grandparents@dosomething.org">grandparents@dosomething.org</a></p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What You Can Do</span></h3>
    <p>By participating you'll do two things: 1) <a href="#headline" class="jump-scroll">help others</a> understand the crazy working conditions poor women face and 2) select a female entrepreneur to receive a $25 Kiva loan. This loan can change her life and her community — that's more than cool, we think that's pretty awesome.</p>
