  <h4>What kind of challenges will there be?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>That’s a secret, but we won’t ask you anything crazy. Each challenge will be something fun that actually has an impact on your school’s environmental footprint. </p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">When are the challenges released?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>First week of March. We’ll send you a text when they’re up and running.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>How long will I have to complete them?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The competition ends on earth day.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>I want to know more!</h4>
  <div>
    <p>No problem. Email your q’s to Greg at <a href="mailto:green@dosomething.org">green@dosomething.org</a>. Completely unrelated, he digs pics of cute animals, so send him some.</p>
