  <h4>What is an energy vampire?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>An energy vampire is an electronic device that uses power even when it’s turned off or in standby mode. Computers, TVs, and cell phone chargers are all energy vampires. Did you know leaving your cell phone charger plugged in uses energy, even if there’s not a phone attached? You can slay these vampires by unplugging them when they’re not in use.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">How much power do energy vampires really suck?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Nationally, energy vampires waste more than $10 billion a year. That’s 100 billion kilowatt hours - enough to power 10 million homes for a year!</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Which vampires suck the most?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>TVs are the biggest culprits, but cable boxes, DVD players, and video game consoles are also big drains. Computers suck less, but since schools generally have more of them, that can add up to MAJOR suckage.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What can I win?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Each time you conquer a room of vampires, take a picture and send it to us for another chance to win a $4,000 scholarship. The team that de-vamps the most rooms will win a $5,000 grant for their school.</p>
