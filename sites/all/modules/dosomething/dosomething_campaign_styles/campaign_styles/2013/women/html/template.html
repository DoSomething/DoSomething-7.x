    <p>What's the deal with global poverty and women? Get the rundown:</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Global Poverty</span></h3>
    <p>A <strong>whopping</strong> 1.3 billion people live on less than $1 a day.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Women and Work</span></h3>
    <p>Women work two-thirds of the world's working hours, produce half of the world's food, but earn only 10% of the world's income and own less than 1% of the world's property. They make up 50% of the world's population, but represent 70% of the world's poor (that ain't right).</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>What You Can Do</span></h3>
    <p>By participating you'll do two things: 1) <a href="#">help others</a> understand the crazy work conditions poor women face and 2) give a $25 loan to help fund a woman's dreams. This loan can change her life and her community &mdash; that's more than cool, we think that's pretty awesome.</p>

   <p>Rosa is a 21 year old mother of two children.

She wants to increase the variety of products even more, offering products like "pupusas" (thick corn tortillas stuffed with beans, cheese, or meat). A loan will help her buy supplies and allow her to create different food items and improve the infrastructure of her stand, to protect her merchandise when it rains. She also hopes to expand her stand and grow it into a large store with basic products so that her customers don't have to travel so far.</p>

    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Frequently Asked Questions</span></h2>

    <h3>Is this free?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Pssh of course! We’ve partnered with Kiva.org, who are supplying the loans from amazing lenders that want to help you make an impact.  All you have to do is share <a href="#">the text experience</a> that shows the working conditions poor women face, and you get to give away the money to a woman in need. It's no cost to you. How fun is spending someone else’s cash? We’re guessing more fun than spending your own (but that’s just us).
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Why women?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Because they rock. But seriously, women are disproportionately affected by poverty. Women will also invest 80% of their resources into their children when given the tools, so by investing in a woman, you’ll not only change her life, you’ll change the world. </p>
    </div>

    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <div>
      <p><strong>Share the experience:</strong> This text experience puts a twist on the “would you rather classic.” Your friends will receive pairs of tough work situations a poor woman faces, and will be prompted to text back what would they do if they were facing these challenges. This text experience is based in one of five countries: Pakistan, El Salvador, Mongolia, Kenya, and the Philippines. Why these countries? They have some of the toughest working conditions for poor women. You’ll also get to try the experience yourself. </p>

      <p><strong>Unlock a Loan:</strong> We’ve partnered with Kiva to help you give this money away. Once you share this text message experience, you’ll be connected to Kiva.org’s website to unlock a loan for a woman launching or running her own small business. You’ll see a list of amazing women to choose who the loan goes to. We have over $600,000 dollars in loans to give, which will help 25,000 women around the world. The best part &mdash; it’s totally free to you! You’ll receive updates on how the loan is being used and what impact it has.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Why $25 loans?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>These women aren’t able to borrow large amounts of money, so even small amounts are able to dramatically help them achieve their goals and help them lift themselves from poverty. Each $25 loan is combined with a few others to give a woman a loan that ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand dollars.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How do I qualify for a scholarship?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>There’s two ways to qualify:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Share the text message experience about the crazy working conditions poor women face with six friends.</li>
        <li>Once you’re directed to Kiva.org’s website, select a woman to receive a $25 loan. It’s completely free to you because the loans are provided by Kiva.org lenders who want to help you make an impact! </li>
      </ol>
      <p>If you do both actions, you’ll double your chances of winning the scholarship!</p>
