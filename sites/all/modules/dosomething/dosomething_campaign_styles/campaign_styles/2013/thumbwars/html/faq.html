  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Is texting and driving really that dangerous?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Totally. Here’s the stat that kills us: on average, texting while driving at 55mph takes your eyes off the road for <b>the length of a football field!</b> And guess who is the most at risk for getting hurt in an accident because of texting and driving? Teens.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Ah! That’s insane! What do I do?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Join Thumb Wars. Enter your email and phone number in the sign up box above. You’ll be entered to receive two pairs of thumb socks in the mail. Once you get them, share them with your friends and family to let them know how dangerous texting and driving can be.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>How do I use the socks?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>First pick a friend or family member that you know texts while driving is a good first step. After that, you can tape the socks to their steering wheel, ask them to wear them while driving for a day, or hide them in the glove compartment. Be creative! Have fun with it! And if you take a picture of what you do and send it to us, you’ll be entered to win a scholarship (more info on that after June 18th).</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Does everybody who signs up get socks?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Not necessarily. When you sign up above you’ll be directed to a page where you have to tell us who you will share the socks with and what you will do with them. If you don’t fill those fields out with something (and not just “i don’t know”) you won’t get them.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>This is kinda silly.</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Isn’t it great? And that’s totally the point. We’ve learned that scare tactics push people away from learning about an issue. Thumb Wars is a way to make it fun for those you care about to learn how to be a bit safer. Go crazy! Have fun!</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Hey! I entered to get some socks! Where are they?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>We start shipping the socks when the campaign begins, on June 18th. It can take up to 12 business days from when you sign up to get them in the mail. Remember, not everybody gets socks - you have to tell us who you’ll share them with and what you’ll do with them when you sign up.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>I didn’t get socks but still want to take part!</h4>
  <div>
    <p>You can still take part <b>and</b> qualify for the scholarship by making your own thumb socks, taking a pic, and sending them to us. </p>
  </div>

  <h4>I have more questions!</h4>
  <div>
    <p>We have more answers! Email Dave at <a href="mailto:thumbwars@dosomething.org">thumbwars@dosomething.org</a> with any other questions you have.</p>
