  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Is texting and driving really that dangerous?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Totally. Here’s the stat that kills us: on average, texting while driving at 55mph takes your eyes off the road for <b>the length of a football field!</b></p>
  </div>

  <h4>Ah! That’s insane! What do I do?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Join Thumb Wars. Enter your email and phone number in the sign up box above. You can then sign up to receive thumb socks. Once you get them, share them with your friends and family to let them know how dangerous texting and driving can be.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>This is kinda silly.</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Isn’t it great? And that’s totally the point. We’ve learned that scare tactics push people away from learning about an issue. Thumb Wars is a way to make it fun for those you care about to learn how to be a bit safer. Go crazy! Have fun!</p>

  <h4>Hey! I entered to get some socks! Where are they?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>We start shipping the socks when the campaign begins, on May 29th. It can take up to 12 business days from when you sign up to get them in the mail. Remember, not everybody gets socks - you have to tell us who you’ll share them with and what you’ll do with them when you sign up.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>I didn’t get socks but still want to take part!</h4>
  <div>
    <p>You can still take part <b>and</b> qualify for the scholarship by making your own thumb socks, taking a pic, and sending them to us. You can also <a href="#scholarship" class="jump_scroll">share the stat</a> above with 6 friends to be eligible for the scholarship</p>
  </div>

  <h4>I have more questions!</h4>
  <div>
