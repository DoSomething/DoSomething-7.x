    <h3>Why should I do this?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Senior Citizens frequently fight depression due to isolation. After the holidays and families return home, this isolation is maximized. Help brighten a senior in your communities day by sending them a Valentines Day card.</p>

    <h3>Can I put all of my cards in one envelope?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yes! As long as you want to send them all to one <a class="jump-scroll" href="#location">Meals on Wheels location</a> they will hand them out for you.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What happens after I send my card?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Once you mail your card to a Meals on Wheels program, they will be received by a staff member and distributed to an older adult in their region.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>There is an older adult in my town I want to give it to. Can I send it there?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yes, just be sure to keep your personal information anonymous. Our guide <a href="//www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/love/love-action-guide.pdf" target="_blank">here</a> can show you how to make an awesome card.</p>
    </div>

      <h3>How do I win the $4,000 scholarship?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>The scholarship winner will be picked randomly. To enter the lottery, make and send a card. To be entered again, make three more cards. There is no limit on the number of times you can enter. Don’t forget to <a href="//www.dosomething.org/loveletters/report-back" target="_blank">tell us</a> about the cards you make -- that’s the only way we will know how many times to enter you into the lottery. Plus, when you report back your photos will appear in the <a class="jump-scroll" href="#gallery">gallery</a>!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What should be in my report back photo?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>You only need to submit one photo with all of your cards. No need to submit separate photos for each card.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I don’t live in the U.S., can I still participate?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Yea! To do so, find an organization in your area that works with older adults and then ask if they would like to receive cards from you. If there isn’t an organization in your area or country, feel free to choose one on <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0Au8JPkI3VX00dEpLZ3U2Nzd1eXgyVlVHMFZfWTZsTHc&usp=sharing" target="_blank">our list</a> and mail your card(s) to the U.S.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Is there anything I shouldn't include in my card?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Since you don't know who will be receiving your cards it is best to avoid any religious or political content. Also, leave off any personally identifiable information. And, of course, be nice!</p>
    </div>

    <h3>I still have questions!</h3>
