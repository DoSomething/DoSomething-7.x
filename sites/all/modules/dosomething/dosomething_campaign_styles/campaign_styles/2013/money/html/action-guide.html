  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Friends are Fun</span></h3>
  <p>Running a drive is way easier with friends. Have a friend who’s into art? Put them on flyer duty. That friend you’ve got on student gov? Sounds like a good person to help spread the word.</p>

  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Time is of the Essence</span></h3>
  <p>Find a day and time that works for everyone, or piggyback on events like the big game, assemblies or dances.</p>
  
  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Contain Yourself</span></h3>
  <p>Location, location, location. Put the box in a high-traffic area (think front of school, local store etc.) or set up multiple can drop-off locations.</p>

  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Location is Key</span></h3>
  <p>Make sure you have somewhere to put all of those empty cans. Check with grocery stores, restaurants, dept. stores to see if they have extra boxes you can snag.</p>

  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Share the Deets</span></h3>
  <p>Here's a stat you can use to get people interested in your drive: When you recycle a can, it saves 95% of the energy it would take to make a brand new one.</p>

  <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Instagram It</span></h3>
  <p>Get creative on Instagram! Love art? Make a sculpture with your cans. Feeling competitive? Take a vid of your friends bowling with the cans. We’ll have themes @dosomething #50cans every week for inspiration.</p>
