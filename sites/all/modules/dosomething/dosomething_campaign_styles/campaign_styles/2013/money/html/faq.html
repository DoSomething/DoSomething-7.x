  <div>
    <p>In order to be entered for the scholarship, you must have at least 2 people attend your workshop. The more the merrier, though! You’ll have a lot more fun if you get together a group of 5 people or more.</p>
  </div>

  <h3>Can I lead more than one session?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Absolutely! You can lead a session for each topic (up to 3), and will get one entry for each submitted session topic’s report back (budgeting, credit, debt).  Just submit separate report back forms for each session to get up to three entries for the $7,500 scholarship.</p>

  <h3>Where should I run my session?</h3>

  <h3>How long is each session?</h3>
  <div>
    <p>Each session should end up taking about 30 minutes from start to finish and our easy to use handbook will give you everything you need to make it fun!</p>
