  <h4>What is I &lt;3 Dad?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Too many men aren’t getting the preventative medical tests they need. Help Dad maintain a healthy heart. Get his blood pressure tested. A healthy heart is way cooler than a cheesy Father’s day card.</p>
  </div>

  <div>
    <p>It’s easy! Take your dad to get his blood pressure tested. Here’s how:</p>

  </div>

  <h4>Can I take somone besides my dad to get his blood pressure checked?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Of course! Grandpas, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, husbands, they all need a healthy heart right?</p>
  </div>

  <h4>If I take another male besides my dad to get his blood pressure checked, will I still be entered to win the scholarship?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Yes. Just remember to upload your photo and <a href="#header" class="jump_scroll">tell us what you did</a> to be eligible to win the scholarship.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>If I take more than one person to get their blood pressure checked, will I increase my chances of winning the scholarship?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Only one entry will be counted for the scholarship, but you’re more than welcome (in fact, encouraged!) to take other men in your life to get their blood pressure tested.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why test his blood pressure?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arteries of the heart. High blood pressure makes the heart work too hard, which can cause heart disease and stroke. (Yikes!) 1 in 5 U.S. adults has high blood pressure and doesn’t know it. It has no signs or symptoms. A blood pressure test is a super easy first step in keeping heart health in check. Sign up to get your dad’s blood pressure tested.</p>

  <h4>What is a blood pressure machine?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>In simply 5 minutes, this machine can measure blood pressure (no lie). Drug stores provide them for free. They’re usually located near the pharmacy section. Here is a picture of what a blood pressure machine typically looks like: <img class="pressuremach" src="//www.dosomething.org/files/campaigns/dad13/pressuremachine.jpg" alt="Blood Pressure Machine"></p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why blood pressure monitors in drug stores?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>There’s a drug store within 5 miles of every citizen in the U.S. (no really, we checked). And they’re free.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>How do I find my local drugstore?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Almost all national drug store chains have a blood pressure monitor. Try <a href="http://www.lifeclinic.com/locator.aspx" target="_blank">this locator</a> to find a drug store with a blood pressure monitor near you.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why is this movement for dads?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Men are 24% less likely than women to have visited a doctor in the last year (are they chicken or what?!). Many men miss the chance to monitor their blood pressure regularly. Women definitely need to monitor their blood pressure too, but for this campaign we’re focused on men because they just aren’t getting to the doctors like they should.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>How is this a gift?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Alright, buying a spotted ties for him is cool. But lower blood pressure reduces risk of heart attack and stroke. Talk about priceless.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Are these blood pressure monitors accurate?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Yup! Although the most accurate way to monitor blood pressure is with a qualified doctor, these monitors provide an estimate of your dad’s blood pressure. It’s better to have a general idea about his heart health than have no knowledge at all! (Ignorance is not bliss.)</p>
  </div>

  <h4>We took his blood pressure, now what?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Tell us what you did to qualify for the scholarship. Make sure to also read <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/prevention/disease/hbppatient.pdf" target="_blank">this great guide</a> from the American Hypertension Society. It will tell you everything you need to know about maintaining good blood pressure and steps to take if your dad gets a high blood pressure reading. Other tips for keeping healthy include eating a healthy diet (lots of fruits and veggies - go easy on the salt), being physically active for at least 2.5 hours per week, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress levels.</p>

  <h4>What do the blood pressure numbers mean?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>There are two numbers that describe blood pressure.The number on top is called systolic pressure, and is the pressure in your blood vessels when your heart beats. The number on bottom is called diastolic pressure, and is the pressure in your blood vessels between heartbeats. Normal blood pressure is 120/80. Anything above 120/80 can be categorized as different types of high blood pressure. <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/prevention/disease/hbppatient.pdf" target="_blank">Read this guide</a> to understand what those categories mean.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>My dad’s blood pressure is higher than 120/80. What do we do?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>A high reading isn’t the end of the world, but the first step in getting your dad’s health back on track. Have him schedule a doctor’s appointment to have it tested again. Use <a href="http://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/Search_HCC.aspx?byCounty=0" target="_blank">this locator</a> to find a cheap (or free) health clinic near you, or use your own family doctor. The doctor will advise what lifestyle changes he should make to ensure his blood pressure is in good order. In the meantime, read the “what can you do to prevent or control high blood pressure” section of <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/prevention/disease/hbppatient.pdf" target="_blank">this guide</a>.</p>
