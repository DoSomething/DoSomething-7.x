  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Could I have taken someone else besides my dad to get his blood pressure taken?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Of course! Grandpas, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, husbands (even moms, aunts, girlfriends, and wives), they all need a healthy heart right? And you’d still be entered to win the scholarship when you sent in your picture.</p>

  <h4>Why test his blood pressure?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arteries of the heart. High blood pressure makes the heart work too hard, which can cause heart disease and stroke. (Yikes!) 1 in 3 U.S. adults has high blood pressure and doesn’t know it. It has no signs or symptoms. A blood pressure test is a super easy first step in keeping heart health in check. Sign up to get your dad’s blood pressure tested.</p>

  <h4>What is a blood pressure machine?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>In simply 5 minutes, this machine can measure blood pressure (no lie). Drug stores provide them for free. They’re usually located near the pharmacy section. Here is a picture of what a blood pressure machine typically looks like:</p>

    <p>Almost all national drug store chains have a blood pressure monitor. Try <a href="http://www.lifeclinic.com/locator.aspx" target="_blank">this locator</a> to find a drug store with a blood pressure monitor near you.</p>

  <h4>Why was this movement for dads?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Men are 24% less likely than women to have visited a doctor in the last year (are they chicken or what?!). Many men miss the chance to monitor their blood pressure regularly. Women definitely need to monitor their blood pressure too, but for this campaign we’re focused on men because they just aren’t getting to the doctors like they should.</p>

  <h4 id="tips">I took his blood pressure, now what?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>After you took the blood pressure, you <a href="#header" class="jump_scroll">told us what you did</a> to qualify for the scholarship. You also read <a href="http://www.ahrq.gov/patients-consumers/prevention/disease/hbppatient.pdf" target="_blank">this great guide</a> from the American Hypertension Society that tells you everything you need to know about maintaining good blood pressure and steps to take if your dad gets a high blood pressure reading. If your dad’s blood pressure was higher than normal, we recommended that you visit a doctor as soon as possible to get expert advice (use this locator to find a cheap (or free) health clinic near you. Other tips for keeping healthy include eating a healthy diet (lots of fruits and veggies - go easy on the salt), being physically active for at least 2.5 hours per week, maintaining a healthy weight, and managing stress levels.)</p>
