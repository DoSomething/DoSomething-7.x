  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Can I take someone besides my dad to get his blood pressure checked?</h4>

    <p>Of course! Grandpas, uncles, cousins, boyfriends, husbands, they all need a healthy heart right? And don’t worry, you’ll still be entered to win the scholarship when you send in your picture.</p>

  <h4>Why test his blood pressure?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Blood pressure is the force of blood against the walls of arteries of the heart. High blood pressure makes the heart work too hard, which can cause heart disease and stroke. (Yikes!) 1 in 3 U.S. adults has high blood pressure and doesn’t know it. It has no signs or symptoms. A blood pressure test is a super easy first step in keeping heart health in check. Sign up to get your dad’s blood pressure tested.</p>

  <h4>What is a blood pressure machine?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>In simply 5 minutes, this machine can measure blood pressure (no lie). Drug stores provide them for free. They’re usually located near the pharmacy section. Here is a picture of what a blood pressure machine typically looks like:</p>

    <p>Almost all national drug store chains have a blood pressure monitor. Try <a href="http://www.lifeclinic.com/locator.aspx" target="_blank">this locator</a> to find a drug store with a blood pressure monitor near you.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why is this movement for dads?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Men are 24% less likely than women to have visited a doctor in the last year (are they chicken or what?!). Many men miss the chance to monitor their blood pressure regularly. Women definitely need to monitor their blood pressure too, but for this campaign we’re focused on men because they just aren’t getting to the doctors like they should.</p>
