    <h3>What happens to all the phones that are donated?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Every phone goes through SecondWave Recycling’s triage department to determine if it is able to be resold or recycled. The money comes from the sale of either the phone or its parts.</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Can I donate chargers and other equipment?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Please only send in phones/batteries. Other accessories can be recycled locally.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What if my cell phone is broken?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>All makes and models are welcome. Working condition is not an issue.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I need to worry about personal data left on phones donated?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>It is recommended to erase all personal data, but SecondWave Recycling will “wipe clean” all data when they receive any phone.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How much of my phone will be donated to my chosen charity?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>100% of the wholesale value of the phone will be donated. Value depends on the quality of the phone.</p>
