    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Domestic Violence and Tech</span></h3>
    <p>- Funding from your refurbished phone can help a survivor learn how to use one to protect themselves.</p>
    <p>- What millions don't realize is technology can be dangerous and potentially lethal when in the hands of abusers.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>How Your Phones Help</span></h3>
    <p>- Nearly all of the materials found in cell phones can be recycled to make new products.</p>
    <p>- The money from your recycled or refurbished phones will benefit NNEDV’s Safety Net program which educates victims on ways to use technology to help find safety and escape their abusers.</p>

    <h3 class="headline-callout"><span>Before Sending</span></h3>
    <p>- Remove your password</p>

    <h2 class="section-header"><span>Frequently Asked Questions:</span></h2>

    <h3>What happens to all the phones that are donated?</h3>
    <div>
      <p> Every phone goes through Second Wave’s triage department to determine if it is able to be resold or recycled. <br /> The money comes from the sale of either the phone or its parts.
      </p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="active">Can I donate chargers and other equipment?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>Please only send in phones/batteries. Other accessories can be recycled locally.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>What if my cell phone is broken?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>All makes and models are welcome. Working condition is not an issue.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Do I need to worry about personal data left on phones donated?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>It is recommended to erase all personal data, but Second Wave will “wipe clean” all data when they receive any phone.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>How much of my phone will be donated to my chosen charity?</h3>
    <div>
      <p>100% of the wholesale value of the phone will be donated. Value depends on the quality of the phone.</p>
