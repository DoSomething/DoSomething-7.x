  <h4>What is Grandparents Gone Wired?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Grandparents Gone Wired urges young people to share their tech knowledge with their grandparents or seniors in their community to help the senior learn to use new forms of technology.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">How does this work?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Well, the campaign is over for now, but participants were able to pick an area of expertise, and share their knowledge with grandparents, elderly family members/friends or seniors living in local senior homes who might have wanted to learn how to use technology to make their lives easier. When they finished teaching, they told us all about their tech lesson and were entered to win a $5000 scholarship.</p>

  <h4>What is Intel?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Intel is an American technology company that is best known for creating microprocessors for computers.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>Why was Intel involved with Grandparents Gone Wired?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Intel’s mission is to create and extend computing technology to connect and enrich the lives of every person on earth. As a result, they partnered with us to help connect seniors and teens across the country.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What did participants receive for doing this?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Besides the feeling that you have helped make someone else’s life better, we’ll be giving away a $5000 scholarship.</p>
  </div> 

  <h4>Did they have to teach a senior how to use Facebook, Skype, and the general computer skills to participate?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Nope! They simply taught whatever form of technology was best for them and then reported back to us about the lesson.</p>
  </div>   

  <h4>Can I still enter to win a scholarship?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Since the campaign has ended, the scholarship and prizes have been awarded already. However, you can still sign up to receive updates about when next year’s campaign will kick off.</p>
