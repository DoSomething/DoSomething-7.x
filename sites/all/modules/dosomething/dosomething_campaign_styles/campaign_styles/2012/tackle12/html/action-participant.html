  <h2>Two Weeks Out:</h2>

    <p><span>Make friends.</span> Contact your local newspaper to see if they’ll do a story on your drive. See how local businesses can support your efforts.</p>

  <h2>Almost There:</h2>
    <p><span>Show up early</span> on the day of your drive to brief your team on their roles and to organize. Take lots of photos and document how much food you’ve collected!</p>
