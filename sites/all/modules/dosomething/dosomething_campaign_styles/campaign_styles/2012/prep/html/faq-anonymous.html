  <h4>What is Pantry Prep?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>We received thousands of requests from individuals who need help after Hurricane Sandy. We're asking young people across the United States to help by running a food drive and donating their items to their local food pantry. This is especially important for people affected by the storm, but even if you weren't affected, disaster preparedness is one biggest ways a community can arm itself when disaster strikes.</p>
  </div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">How can canned and dry food help?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Food banks play a critical role when a disaster strikes. They provide food to people who may lose access to food, power, or their homes. Donating non-perishable items such as canned and dry goods makes it easier for food banks to distribute food to families when a disaster strikes with little waste.</p>
  </div>

  <h4>What type of food should I collect?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Food banks most frequently requested items include:</p>
    <ul>
