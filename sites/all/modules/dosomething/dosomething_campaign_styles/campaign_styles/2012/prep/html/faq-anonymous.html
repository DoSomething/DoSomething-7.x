  <h4>What is Pantry Prep?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Every county in the United States is affected by hunger. We're asking young people across the United States to stock their local food pantry to help hungry families in their community. Collect just 25 items, drop them off at your <a href="#search" class="jump_scroll">local food bank</a>, and you'll qualify for a <a href="#impact" class="jump_scroll">5,000 scholarship</a>. It's super simple and really helpful to families that need it most.</p>
