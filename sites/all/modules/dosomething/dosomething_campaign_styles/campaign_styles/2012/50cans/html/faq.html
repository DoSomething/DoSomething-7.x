  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Why should I recycle aluminum cans?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The aluminum can is one of the most valuable recyclable consumer products and the only packaging solution that allows for complete recyclability. Recycled aluminum cans can be back on the store shelf in as little as 60 days and require 95% less energy, generate 95% less emission and create 97% less water pollution than producing the new metal from ore. An aluminum can is incredibly valuable; the industry estimates that, in the United States, nearly 50 billion aluminum cans are thrown away annually; that's $800 million annually being buried in American landfills.</p>

  <h4>What's the difference between the recycling process of aluminum cans versus paper or plastic bottles?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Aluminum is one of the most reusable sources available and can be used over and over and over again indefinitely. Two very commonly recycled materials, paper (because of the fibers) and plastic (because of its molecular structure), are limited in the number of times they can be recycled, and the quality eventually degrades to a non-reusable state.</p>
