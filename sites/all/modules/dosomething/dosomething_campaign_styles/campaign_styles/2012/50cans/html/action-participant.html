  <h2>Step 1:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Running a drive is way easier w/ friends. Assemble your crew by choosing friends that’ll bring different strengths to the table. <a href="#scholarship" class="jump_scroll">Invite</a> your friends to come donate or help you plan your drive.</span></li>
    <li><span>Need some help getting your friends pumped? Share these <a href="social" class="jump_scroll">stats</a> with them to tell them why they should care.</span></li>
    <li><span>Pick a location and make sure to get permission from whoever’s in charge of the space.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 2:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span>Now that you have a place and time picked out, let people know your drive is where it’s at.</span></li>
    <li><span>Talk to your school newspaper, see if they’ll print a story about your drive.</span></li>
    <li><span>Don’t stop advertising until the drive is over. Print flyers,  send emails, create a Facebook group, blow up peoples’ walls.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Step 3:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span>On the day of your drive, make sure you’ve got enough bags, boxes etc. to collect cans (check with local grocery stores, restaurants etc to see if they’ve got some to spare).</span></li>
    <li><span>Take lots of pictures of your drive.</span></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Bring it home:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><span><a class="jump_scroll" href="#impact">Upload your pics</a> and tell us how many cans you collected.</span></li>
    <li><span>Don’t stop there, share them with all of the people who helped you out and let them know what they helped you do.</span></li>
  </ul>
