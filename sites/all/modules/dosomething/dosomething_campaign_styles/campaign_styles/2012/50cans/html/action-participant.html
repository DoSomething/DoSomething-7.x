  <h2>Do This Now!</h2>
  <p>Once you have a date, location, and time, edit the info above for everyone who signs up for your drive.</p>
  <p><a class="jump_scroll" href="#scholarship">Invite your friends</a> to attend or help you plan your drive.</p>
  <p>Secure a public location. Make sure to ask permission. (Why not ask them to help advertise your drive.)</p>

  <h2>Two Weeks Out</h2>
  <p>Start advertising your drive by sharing some of <a href="#social" class="jump_scroll">these stats</a> on your friends Facebook wall.</p>
  <p>Reach out to your college paper, and a local paper to see if they'll do a story on your drive.</p>
  <p>Continue to advertise - print fliers, get on your school radio, send out emails!</p>

  <h2>Almost There</h2>
  <p>On the day of your drive, show up 1 hour before your drive to have a status and training meeting with your recruiter. You and your volunteers will recruit, hand out forms and help with cheek swabbing.</p>
  <p>Take pictures of all the people swabbing their cheeks! Uploading to social? Use <b>#(campaign)</b>.</p>

  <h2>Wrap It Up!</h2>
