  <h4>HOW CAN I GET INVOLVED?</h4>
  <div><p>Run a jeans drive at your school or individually by signing up here (link to sign up module). Spread the word and collect gently worn jeans from the people in your community, then visit your local A&Eacute;ropostale or P.S. from A&Eacute;ropostale store to drop off what you collect and get 25% off a new pair of jeans!</p></div>

  <h4>WHEN I DONATE JEANS, WHERE DO THEY GO?</h4>
  <div><p>DoSomething, A&Eacute;ropostale and P.S. from A&Eacute;ropostale have partnered with over 1000 homeless shelters across the U.S., Canada and Puerto Rico. Your jeans will be donated to a homeless shelter in your local community.</p></div>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">IF I DONATE MORE THAN ONE PAIR OF JEANS, DO I GET MORE THAN ONE COUPON?</h4>
  <div><p>Yes. When you donate your jeans at A&Eacute;ropostale or P.S. from A&Eacute;ropostale, you'll receive one 25% coupon for each pair of jeans you donate.</p></div>

  <h4>HOW DO I GET A COUPON FOR AN ADDITIONAL 25% OFF A NEW PAIR OF JEANS?</h4>
  <div><p>Bring your jeans into your local A&Eacute;ropostale or P.S. from A&Eacute;ropostale store--you'll get one coupon for each pair of jeans you donate. </p></div>

  <h4>CAN I RUN A DRIVE AT MY PLACE OF WORSHIP OR OTHER COMMUNITY CENTER?</h4>
  <div><p>Yes. It will function just like a school drive, but you can collect jeans anywhere you want to as long as everyone involved knows where to drop off what they collect.</p></div>

  <h4>WHAT SIZES OF JEANS ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?</h4>
  <div><p>Homeless shelters often have a greater need for large sizes, but we will be happy to accept jeans of all sizes for this campaign. All of the jeans should be in good condition.</p></div>

  <h4>IS A&Eacute;ROPOSTALE AND P.S. FROM A&Eacute;ROPOSTALE ACCEPTING OTHER CLOTHES BESIDES JEANS?</h4>
  <div><p>For the current Teens for Jeans campaign, we are just collecting jeans. If you have extra hats, shirts, etc., please donate them directly to your local homeless shelter or charity.</p></div>

  <h4>DOES EVERY A&Eacute;ROPOSTALE AND P.S. FROM A&Eacute;ROPOSTALE STORE PARTICIPATE IN THIS CAMPAIGN?</h4>
  <div><p>Yes. Every A&Eacute;ropostale and P.S. from A&Eacute;ropostale store will be accepting jean donations.</p></div>

  <h4>DOES IT MATTER WHAT BRAND OF JEANS I DONATE?</h4>
  <div><p>Nope. We want to collect as many jeans as possible! All we ask is that they are in good condition.</p></div>

  <h4>IF I'M A SHELTER THAT WANTS TO BE INVOLVED AS A JEANS BENEFICIARY, WHAT DO I DO?</h4>
  <div><p>Please send an email to <a href="mailto:teensforjeans@dosomething.org">teensforjeans@dosomething.org</a> and we will get back to you about participating in next year's campaign.</p></div>
