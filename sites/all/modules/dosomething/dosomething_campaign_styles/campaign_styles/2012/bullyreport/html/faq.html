    <p>Give A Spit About Cancer is a campaign run by DoSomething.org in partnership with Be The Match. We're asking young people to run cheek swab drives on their college campuses or in their communities to increase the number of potential donors on the National Registry. Once a person swabs their cheek at a drive, and sends in the health consent form, they will be added to the registry and can possibly be DNA matched to a leukemia or lymphoma patient in need. The potential donor is called and asked if they want to donate and has the chance to agree, defer, or deny donation.<br>In order to get involved, just sign up to run or support a drive in your community.</p>

  <h4 class="activeFAQ">What is a bone marrow transplant?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Bone marrow transplant is a life-saving treatment for people with blood cancers like leukemia and lymphoma, sickle cell and other life-threatening diseases. First, patients undergo chemotherapy and sometimes radiation to destroy their diseased marrow. Then a donor's healthy blood-forming cells are given directly into the patient's bloodstream, where they can begin to function and multiply.</p>
    <p>For a patient's body to accept these healthy cells, the patient needs a donor who is a close match. Seventy percent of patients do not have a donor in their family and depend on the Be The Match Registry to find an unrelated donor.</p>

  <h4>How do I become a donor?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>The first step to become a bone marrow donor is to join the Be The Match Registry. Give A Spit can help you do that! Doctors around the world search our registry to find a match for their patients. If a doctor selects you as a match for a patient, you may be asked to donate bone marrow or cells from circulating blood (called PBSC donation).</p>
