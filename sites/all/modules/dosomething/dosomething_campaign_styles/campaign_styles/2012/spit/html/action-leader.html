<h1><b>DO THIS NOW!</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>A Be The Match recruiter will be in touch to help with your drive logistics. Once you have a date, location, and time, edit the info above for everyone who signs up for your drive.</li>
<li><a href="#" class="trigger-invite-popup">Invite your friends</a> to attend or help you plan your drive.</li>
<li>Secure a public location. Make sure to ask permission. (Why not ask them to help advertise your drive.)</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>TWO WEEKS OUT</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>Start advertising your drive by sharing some of <a href="/spit12#social" class="jump_scroll">these stats</a> on your friends Facebook wall.</li>
<li>Reach out to your college paper, and a local paper to see if they'll do a story on your drive.</li>
<li>Continue to advertise - print fliers, get on your school radio, send out emails!</li>
</ul>

<h1><b>ALMOST THERE</b></h1>
<ul>
<li>On the day of your drive, show up 1 hour before your drive to have a status and training meeting with your recruiter. You and your volunteers will recruit, hand out forms and help with cheek swabbing.</li>
<li>Take pictures of all the people swabbing their cheeks! Uploading to social? Use <strong>#GiveASpit</strong></li>
</ul>

<h1><b>WRAP IT UP!</b></h1>
<ul>
  <li><a href="/spit12/report-back">upload</a> your pics and tell us how many cheeks you swabbed!</li>
</ul>
