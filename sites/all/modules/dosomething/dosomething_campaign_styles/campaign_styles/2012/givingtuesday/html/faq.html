  <h4 class="activeFAQ">Where will my money go?</h4>
  <div>
    <p>Your money will help keep DoSomething.org awesome. Almost every week, we launch a new national campaign. The call to action is always something that has a real impact and doesnâ€™t require money, an adult, or a car. With a goal of 5 million active members by 2015, DoSomething.org is one of the largest organizations in the US for teens and social change.</p>
