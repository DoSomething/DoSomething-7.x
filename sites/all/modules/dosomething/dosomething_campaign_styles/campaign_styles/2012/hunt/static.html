<!--      FAQ      -->
<div id="faq-section">
<p>Got questions about how to participate in this year’s Hunt? Check these out!</p>

<h3>1. What is The Hunt?</h3>
<p>The Hunt is 11 days of challenges that can win you prizes AND make your community a better place.</p>

<h3>2. How does The Hunt work?</h3>
<p>Each day starting July 10th we'll send daily challenges right to your cell phone or e-mail inbox. Alternately, you can check out the daily challenges right here. If you're not currently signed up to receive challenges on your cell phone, you can text HUNT to 38383 and get daily text messages. The challenges will always be something you can do in your community, alone or with your team.</p>

<h3>3. Can I report back after the 20th?</h3>
<p>No, you have until midnight on July 20th to report back on all completed challenges.</p>

<h3>4. Can I only complete a challenge for a specific day on that day?</h3>
<p>Nope! Once a challenge is released, you're welcome to complete it throughout The Hunt. For example, you can complete Day 1's challenges on Day 5! Just make sure you tell us you completed the challenge by July 20th.</p>

<h3>5. How do I tell you I’ve completed the challenge?</h3>
<p>If you are using your cell phone, you will need to stay tuned for each challenge and the keyword required to report that you've completed it. If you are using the web, you will just need to click the Tell Us button next to that day’s challenge. </p>

<h3>6. Do I have to be on a team?</h3>
<p>Nope, if you want you can take part all by yourself. We definitely suggest that you join with a team, though- the more team members you have, the more points you can get, and getting more points gives you a bigger chance of winning a trip to L.A.!</p>

<h3>7. How big do teams have to be?</h3>
<p>Teams can be as small as you and your best friend or as big as 11 people to be eligible for prizing.</p>

<h3>8. Does every team member need to report back?</h3>
<p>One or all of your team members can report back. We know what team you're on, so your points will only be counted once. BUT, we will be giving away Lenovo Ultrabooks as a daily prize for individuals who tell us that they have completed the UltraBonus. So, everyone on your team who reports back has a chance to win a laptop of their own.</p>

<h3>9. How do I send in a photo?</h3>
<p>If you are using your mobile phone, you can text the picture to us. If you are participating via the web, you will be able to submit it online. When you send in a pic, you will receive an extra 25 points for that challenge! So, get snapping!</p>

<h3>10. How can I win prizes?</h3>
<p>We're giving out Lenovo Ultrabook laptops for different actions each day. We can’t tell you exactly what you’ll have to do each day without giving away the challenges. But, we can tell you how to make sure that you’re eligible to win. To be eligible to win prizes make sure that you:
Complete a challenge and tell us about it.
Verify that you've completed a challenge by snapping a pic and uploading it when you report back, or by texting the photo to us.</p>

<h3>11. How can I win a scholarship?</h3>
<p>We're awarding a $6000-11,000 scholarship one randomly selected team. You must invite at least 5 people to join your team to qualify. Everyone on the team (up to 11 members) will be eligible for a $1,000 scholarship.</p>

<h3>12. How do I verify that I did a challenge?</h3>
<p>To verify with your phone, just follow the instructions that we'll text out to you. To verify online, go to the challenges page and click the “Tell Us” button.</p>

<h3>13. How can I get to the Do Something Awards?</h3>
<p>The team that earns the most points (by completing the most challenges) will win a trip for up to 11 teammates to Los Angeles, California for the 2011 Do Something Awards. So sign your team up and get started!</p>

<h3>14. How do I know how many points I have?</h3>
<p>Once you report back for each day’s challenges, we will tally your points and add them to your total points, which you can see on your team page.</p>

<h3>15. Um, you didn't answer my question.</h3>
<p>Whoops. Sorry about that, but we've still got you covered.  If you have more questions just email hunt@dosomething.org or text HUNTHELP to 38383.</p>
