<?php echo $name; ?>,

You got <?php echo $invitee; ?> to sign the petition, "<?php echo $petition; ?>."  Score!

Looks like people actually listen to you, which means your voice really matters.  Each new signature brings us closer to reaching our goal and making an impact.  We'd love if you could invite more of your friends to sign.

You can send them here: <?php echo $petition_link; ?>

Thanks for kicking ass on things you care about - and influencing others to do the same.
