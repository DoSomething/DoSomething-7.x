Dear <?php echo $name; ?>,

We've reached our goal: "<?php echo $petition; ?>" has collected over <?php echo $goal; ?> signatures.

We're now sending these signatures to the <?php echo $petition_recipient; ?>.  We'll let you know when that happens

Thanks for taking action,
<?php echo $author; ?> and the DoSomething.org Team
