Hey,

I just signed the petition "<?php echo $title; ?>" because it's something I care about.  It would mean so much to me if you could sign, too, and share with friends.

Our goal is to reach <?php echo $signatures; ?> signatures, and we need your support to get there.  Step up, speak out, and sign here: <?php echo $url; ?>

Every voice and every name matters.

Thanks in advance for both of yours,
<?php echo $first_name; ?>
