<p>Hey,</p>

<p>I just signed the petition "<?php echo $title; ?>" because it's something I care about.  It would mean so much to me if you could sign, too, and share with friends.</p>

<p>Our goal is to reach <?php echo $signatures; ?> signatures, and we need your support to get there.</p>

<p>Step up, speak out, and sign here: <?php echo $url; ?>.</p>

<p>Every voice and every name matters.  Thanks in advance for both of yours.</p>
