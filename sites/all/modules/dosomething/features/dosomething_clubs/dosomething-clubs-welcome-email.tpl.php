<p>Hi <?php echo check_plain($name); ?>!</p>

<p>Thanks for deciding to start a DoSomething.org Club<?php echo $andwelcome; ?>.</p>

<p>What to do now...<br />
<ul>
  <li>Hang tight, if you signed up to receive a DoSomething.org Clubs Kit, it'll be sent to you sometime in the next 1-2 weeks, but don't let that delay you from getting things started!</li>
  <li>Invite friends to join your Clubs Profile page.  Lots of them.  The more the better.</li>
  <li>Customize your Clubs Profile.  Did you add photos or add officer positions and projects that you will be working on?</li>
  <li>Check out our resources at DoSomething.org/clubresources for tips and print outs to get things started right.</li>
  <li>Rally up the crew for a first meeting to plan which DoSomething.org campaigns you want to join and any projects you're going to do this year!</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Click here now to get started:
