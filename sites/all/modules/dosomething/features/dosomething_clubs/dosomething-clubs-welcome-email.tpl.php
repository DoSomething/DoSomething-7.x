Hi <?php echo check_plain($name); ?>!

Thanks for deciding to start a DoSomething.org Club<?php echo $andwelcome; ?>.

What to do now...
- Hang tight, if you signed up to receive a DoSomething.org Clubs Kit, it'll be sent to you sometime in the next 1-2 weeks, but don't let that delay you from getting things started!
- Invite friends to join your Clubs Profile page.  Lots of them.  The more the better.
- Customize your Clubs Profile.  Did you add photos or add officer positions and projects that you will be working on?
- Check out our resources at DoSomething.org/clubresources for tips and print outs to get things started right.
- Rally up the crew for a first meeting to plan which DoSomething.org campaigns you want to join and any projects you're going to do this year!
