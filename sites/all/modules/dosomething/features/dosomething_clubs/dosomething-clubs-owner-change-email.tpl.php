<p>Hi <?php echo $name; ?>!</p>

<p>A group admin from "<?php echo $club; ?>" has promoted you to Club Leader.</p>

<p>As a club leader you can now upload photos, choose a new shipping address for your DoSomething.org Clubs Kit, post your meeting dates and goals, update officer titles, and as always...invite more members to join! The more people who are involved in your club the greater impact you can have on your community. And when you get enough members registered, your club will be eligible for additional incentives!</p>

<p>Click here now to get started:<br />
