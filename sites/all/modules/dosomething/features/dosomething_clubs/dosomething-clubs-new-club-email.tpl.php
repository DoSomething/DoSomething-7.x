Hi <?php echo check_plain($name); ?>!

<p />Thanks for deciding to start a DoSomething.org Club<?php echo $andwelcome; ?>.

<p />What to do now...
<br />- Hang tight, your DoSomething.org Clubs Kit is on its way to you!
<br />- Invite friends to join your Clubs Profile page.  Lots of them.  The more the better.
<br />- Customize your Clubs Profile.  Did you add photos or add officer positions and projects that you will be working on?
<br />- Check out our resources at DoSomething.org/clubresources for tips and print outs to get things started right.
<br />- Rally up the crew for a first meeting where you can plan all the ways you're going to make a difference this year!
