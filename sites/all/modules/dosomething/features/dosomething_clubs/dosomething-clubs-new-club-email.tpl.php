<p>Hi <?php echo check_plain($name); ?>!</p>

<p>Thanks for deciding to start a DoSomething.org Club<?php echo $andwelcome; ?>.</p>

<p>What to do now...</p>
<ul>
  <li>Hang tight, your DoSomething.org Clubs Kit is on its way to you!</li>
  <li>Invite friends to join your Clubs Profile page.  Lots of them.  The more the better.</li>
  <li>Customize your Clubs Profile.  Did you add photos or add officer positions and projects that you will be working on?</li>
  <li>Check out our resources at DoSomething.org/clubresources for tips and print outs to get things started right.</li>
  <li>Rally up the crew for a first meeting where you can plan all the ways you're going to make a difference this year!</li>
</ul>
