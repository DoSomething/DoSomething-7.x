Hi <?php echo $name; ?>!

A group admin from "<?php echo $club; ?>" has given you administrator privelages of their page.

As a club admin, you can now update officer titles, and as always...invite more members to join! The more people who are involved in your club, the greater the impact you can have on your community.  And when you get enough members registered, you club will be eligible for additional incentives!

Click here now to get started:
