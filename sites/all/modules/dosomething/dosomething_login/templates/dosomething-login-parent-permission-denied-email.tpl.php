<p>Yikes, you've been denied membership to <?php print check_plain(variable_get('site name', 'Do Something.org')); ?> by your parent or guardian. 

<br /><br />If you really want to hang out on our site and have access to all of our opportunities, bug your parent/guardian to give you permission 
to our 
site.

<br/><br/>Here are some reasons to convince them... With DoSomething.org, you can:
<list>
<ul>
<li>create a social action club
<li>share the details of a project you've worked on
<li>sign up for activities like collection drives, eco-friendly challenges, and more.
<li>If you have any questions or need our help getting permission, please email help@dosomething.org.
</ul>
</list>

Good luck,

<br /><br />The DoSomething.org Team</p>
