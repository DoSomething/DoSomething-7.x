<strong>Hey there!</strong>

We've all done something crazy to save money... some of us have done more than others. If you haven't already, <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/crazy/submit/start">submit your story</a> and you will be entered to win a $4,000 scholarship to help you avoid crazy things in the future. (contest rules here)
			     
I'll send you some highlighted stories every so often, along with a couple ideas on how they could have sanely saved money instead.  Our site is still in beta right now, so if you have any comments that could help us make it better, <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tDNHmnIrbBwXs7yrsA5Mdw4eFKTBEbQ6-0li3hQax7U/viewform">click here.</a></strong>


Stay Crazy,
Greg from DoSomething.org
