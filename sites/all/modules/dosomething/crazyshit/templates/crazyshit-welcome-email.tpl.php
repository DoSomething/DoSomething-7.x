<strong>Hey there!</strong>

<p>We’ve all done something crazy to save money..some of us have done more than others.  If you haven’t already, <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/crazy/submit/start">submit your story</a> and you’ll be entered to win a $4,000 scholarship to help you avoid crazy things in the future. (contest rules here)</p>

<p>Be sure to keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/crazy">gallery</a> to see the crazy stories that people share, and even check out what your <a href="http://www.dosomething.org/crazy/friends">friends have done</a>.</p>

<p>I’ll send you some highlighted stories every so often, along with a couple ideas on how they could have sanely saved money instead.  Our site is still in beta right now, so if you have any comments that could help us make it better, <strong><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1tDNHmnIrbBwXs7yrsA5Mdw4eFKTBEbQ6-0li3hQax7U/viewform">click here.</a></strong></p>

<p>Stay Crazy,<br />
